Welcome to the PGAA Data Analysis Program v0.1.0
Requirements may be installed with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" (run while inside this folder).
You can run the program (from either a command prompt for normal python or an Anaconda prompt for Anaconda) using the command "python main.py" (again from within this folder).
